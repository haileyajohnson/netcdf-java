# aws shared credentials file for use by tests
# note: we do not actually store credentials here! Don't even think about it.
#       we use this to set aws regions for tests to use and that's it.
#
# default: Asia Pacific (Mumbai). A region that does not contain any data we use
# we use this to make sure overrides work
# also allow us to test the failure case where a bucket isn't available in a region
[default]
region=ap-south-1

# the region where the goes 16/17 bucket lives
